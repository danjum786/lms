You should start by creating the Users table first. Here's the reasoning and the recommended order:

Users Table: This table is foundational because it contains all users (admin, instructors, and students) with their roles. Other tables, like Courses, Quizzes, and Enrollments, have foreign keys that reference user_id in the Users table.

Courses Table: After Users, create the Courses table, as it is a key entity in the platform and does not depend on any other table besides Users. The Courses table also contains a created_by field that links to an instructor's user_id.

Lessons Table: Since lessons are associated with courses, create the Lessons table next. This table has a foreign key referencing the course_id in the Courses table, establishing the course-to-lesson relationship.

Quizzes Table: Quizzes are linked to courses and created by instructors, so create the Quizzes table after Courses. This table has foreign keys for both course_id and created_by (from the Users table).

Quiz Questions Table: Once the quizzes table is set up, you can create the Quiz_Questions table. Each question is tied to a specific quiz.

Quiz Options Table: After creating quiz questions, set up the Quiz_Options table to store the possible answer choices for each question.

Student Quiz Attempts Table: Now, create the Student_Quiz_Attempts table, as it will track each student’s attempts for a quiz. This table references both quiz_id and student_id.

Student Answers Table: This table stores each answer for a student’s quiz attempt and is related to the Student_Quiz_Attempts, Quiz_Questions, and Quiz_Options tables.

Enrollments Table: Next, create the Enrollments table to track which students are enrolled in each course. This will link student_id to course_id.

Results Table: Finally, create the Results table to store overall course results for each student.
